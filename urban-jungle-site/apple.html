            <h2>The King of Fruits</h2>
            <p>
                The apple tree (<em>Malus domestica</em>) is perhaps the most iconic fruit tree in the world.
                Originating in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, <em>Malus sieversii</em>, is still found today,
                apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by
                European colonists.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, apples are a symbol of health, vitality, and harvest. Whether you are looking to bake a classic
                pie, press fresh cider, or simply enjoy a crisp snack straight from the branch, growing your own apple
                tree is a deeply rewarding experience. While they require patience and care—often taking several years
                to bear their first significant crop—the result is a lifetime of fruit. A well-tended apple tree can
                live and produce for over 100 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this guide, we will cover everything you need to know to nurture these trees, from selecting the
                right cultivar for your climate to mastering the art of pruning.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Apples are famous for a reason. "An apple a day," as the saying goes. They
                are packed with fiber, Vitamin C, and various antioxidants. Below is the nutritional breakdown for a
                medium-sized apple (approx. 182g).</p>

                    <h3>❤️ Heart Health</h3>
                    <p>Apples contain soluble fiber, which can help lower blood cholesterol levels. They also contain
                        polyphenols, which have antioxidant effects linked to reduced risk of stroke.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="benefit-card">
                    <h3>⚖️ Weight Control</h3>
                    <p>High in fiber and water, apples are filling. Studies suggest that eating whole apples can
                        increase feelings of fullness, helping to manage appetite and weight.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="benefit-card">
                    <h3>🛡️ Gut Health</h3>
                    <p>Apples contain pectin, a type of fiber that acts as a prebiotic. This feeds the good bacteria in
                        your gut (microbiota), which is essential for overall health and digestion.</p>

                    <h3>🩸 Blood Sugar</h3>
                    <p>Despite their sweetness, apples have a low glycemic index (GI). The fiber slows down digestion
                        and the absorption of sugar, keeping blood sugar levels stable.</p>

        <!-- Growing Steps -->
        <section class="guide-section">
            <h2>How to Grow</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">Growing apples requires planning. Unlike some garden vegetables, you are
                planting for the next decade, not just the next season. Follow these steps for a thriving orchard.</p>

            <div class="steps-list">
                <div class="step-card">
                    <span class="step-number">01</span>
                    <div class="step-content">
                        <h3>Choose Your Variety & Rootstock</h3>
                        <p><strong>Pollination is Key:</strong> Most apple trees are not self-fertile. You will likely
                            need two different varieties that bloom at the same time to get fruit. For example, a Granny
                            Smith might pollinate a Fuji, but verify their bloom times properly.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Rootstock:</strong> The size of your tree is determined
                            by the rootstock.
                            <br>• <em>Dwarf:</em> Grows 8-10 ft tall. Good for small yards. Needs staking.
                            <br>• <em>Semi-Dwarf:</em> Grows 12-15 ft tall. Sturdier, good yield.
                            <br>• <em>Standard:</em> Grows 20+ ft. Huge trees, taking longer to fruit.
                        </p>

                    <div class="step-content">
                        <h3>Site Selection & Soil</h3>
                        <p>Apples crave the sun. They need at least <strong>6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight</strong>
                            daily. Morning sun is particularly important to dry off dew, which helps prevent fungal
                            diseases.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">They prefer well-draining soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. If
                            you have heavy clay, amend it organically or plant on a mound to improve drainage. Avoid
                            low-lying "frost pockets" where cold air settles, as late spring frosts can kill blossoms.

                        <h3>Planting</h3>
                        <p>The best time to plant is <strong>early spring</strong>, as soon as the soil can be worked.
                            Dig a hole twice as wide as the root system and just as deep.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">Spread the roots out gently. Ensure the <em>graft union</em> (the
                            bump on the lower trunk where the variety meets the rootstock) is 2-3 inches above the soil
                            line. If you bury the graft, the variety may grow its own roots, overriding the dwarf
                            characteristics.</p>

                        <h3>Pruning (The Art)</h3>
                        <p>Pruning is the most intimidating part for new growers, but it is essential. The goal is to
                            open up the center of the tree to light and air.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>When:</strong> Prune in late winter while the tree is
                            dormant.</p>
                        <p><strong>How:</strong> Remove the "3 D's": Dead, Damaged, and Diseased wood. Then, remove
                            "suckers" (growth from the base) and "water sprouts" (vertical shoots from branches).
                            Finally, thin out crossing branches to prevent rubbing.</p>

                        <h3>Thinning the Fruit</h3>
                        <p>It sounds counter-intuitive, but you must remove fruit to get fruit. In early summer, apple
                            trees often drop some fruit naturally ("June Drop"). After this, you should hand-thin the
                            remaining clusters.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">Leave only one apple per cluster, spaced about 6-8 inches apart.
                            This prevents branches from breaking under heavy weight and ensures the remaining apples
                            grow large and sweet rather than small and tart.</p>
